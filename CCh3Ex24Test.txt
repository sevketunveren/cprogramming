The Sentinelese, as they're known, are protected by Indian law to preserve their way of life and protect them from modern illnesses to which they have no immunity.
Laws banning outsiders from going within five nautical miles of the island are also there to protect strangers because the tribe, which has lived on the island for tens of thousands of years, has a history of forcefully repelling outsiders.

Their numbers have declined in recent years, but accurate counts are hard to obtain because the Sentinelese can only be observed from a distance due to the dangers in approaching the tribe.
According to India's 2011 census, only 15 Sentinelese were estimated to remain on the island.
Described as "arguably the most enigmatic people on our planet," by Norwegian geneticist Erika Hagelberg, the wider group of Andaman Islanders, which comprises several distinct tribal groups, was largely isolated until the island chain was turned into a British penal colony in the 19th century.
